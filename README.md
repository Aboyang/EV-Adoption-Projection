The shift towards Electric Vehicles (EV) has become a global phenomenon in response to climate change and the need for more sustainable transport. As a result, Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption has been growing globally, but adoption rates vary significantly across regions due to factors such as infrastructure, government incentives, fuel prices, and consumer preferences. Understanding these factors can help policymakers and businesses accelerate EV adoption.

This project aims to analyse and investigate the correlation between three key variables:
- EV Sales
- Charging Infrastructure Availability
- Fuel Prices
  
We hypothesise that:
- An increase in the number of EV charging stations is positively correlated with an increase in EV adoption.
- An increase in gasoline prices is positively correlated with an increase in EV adoption, as customers seek cost-efficient alternatives to vehicles fueled by gasoline.

To validate this hypothesis, we will analyse historical data and apply **regression** and **time series forecasting** techniques to model interdependencies and trends for the past years, as well as projections for future years. The findings can help policymakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure planners make data-driven decisions surrounding EVs and their adoption.

Moreover, we chose to narrow our investigation down to within the United States for several reasons:
- Leader in Global EV Growth: The USA has one of the most influential and rapidly growing EV markets globally. The country's national goals complement this, such as aiming for 50% of new car sales to be EVs by 2030. This allows the USA's EV landscape to greatly complement our investigation.
- Accelerated EV Infrastructure: The USA has committed billions of dollars to expanding EV infrastructure, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which allocates over $7.5 billion to public charging networks.
- Ideal Case Study for Policy: The USA's policies, fluctuating fuel prices, and growing public awareness on EVs makes it an ideal real-world case study for investigating how economic and infrastructural factors influence EV adoption.
Thus, focusing on the US not only gives us ample data to work with and analyse, but also produce insights that are highly applicable and relevant to current and future policymaking and infrastructure planning.
